- Note: Callers can use battle.dex.conditions.get() if they need full condition data

#### get_weight.rs
- Status: ✅ Fixed (Documented)
- Issue: "TODO: implement the same logic as JavaScript"
- Action: Implemented Math.max(1, weight_hg) and documented missing ModifyWeight event
- Note: Full implementation requires Battle reference for runEvent('ModifyWeight')

#### run_effectiveness.rs
- Status: ✅ Fixed (Documented)
- Issue: "TODO: implement the same logic as JavaScript"
- Action: Documented simplified implementation and what's needed for full equivalence
- Note: Missing singleEvent/runEvent calls, Tera Shell ability, Stellar type handling

- Issue: Setting last_damage field that doesn't exist in JavaScript
- Action: Removed last_damage assignment to match JS exactly

- Status: ✅ Fixed (New entry)
- Issue: Missing Hidden Power normalization logic
- Action: Added Hidden Power normalization (all variants normalize to "hiddenpower")

#### get_health.rs
- Status: ✅ Fixed (New file)
- Issue: Method was missing entirely

- Action: Implemented to return nature from set or calculated from PID
- Notes:
  - Uses modulo 25 calculation when nature not explicitly set

#### move_used.rs
- Status: ✅ Fixed (Documented)
- Issue: Missing lastMoveEncore tracking for Gen 2
- Action: Documented that method tracks move usage but Gen 2 lastMoveEncore not implemented
- Notes:

- Status: ✅ Fixed (Documented)
- Issue: Partial implementation missing ability flags and Neutralizing Gas check
- Action: Documented what's implemented and what's missing
- Notes:
  - Missing ability.flags['notransform'] check with transformed
  - Missing ability.flags['cantsuppress'] check
  - Missing Neutralizing Gas check (needs Battle.getAllActive())
