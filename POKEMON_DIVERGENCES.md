- Issue: Method was missing entirely
- Action: Implemented to return nature from set or calculated from PID
- Notes:
  - Uses modulo 25 calculation when nature not explicitly set

### Rust-Specific Helpers (May be intentional)

The following are marked as "NOTE: This method is NOT in JavaScript - Rust-specific implementation":
- boost.rs
- can_switch.rs
- can_tera.rs
- clear_switch_state.rs
- clear_turn_state.rs
- clear_volatile_full.rs
- clear_volatiles.rs
- copy_volatile_from_full.rs
